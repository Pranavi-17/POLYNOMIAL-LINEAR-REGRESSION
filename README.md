# Problem Statement:
### This project aims to employ Polynomial Linear Regression to predict salary levels based on job positions and experience. The dataset includes various job titles, experience levels, and corresponding salaries. The primary objective is to build an accurate model that estimates salaries based on these two key factors. By doing so, we can provide valuable insights to both job seekers and employers. Job seekers can better understand the salary expectations associated with different positions and experience levels, enabling them to negotiate competitive compensation packages. Employers can use this model to make data-driven decisions when determining salary structures, contributing to fairer and more transparent hiring practices. Ultimately, this project seeks to bridge the information gap in the job market, promoting equity and informed decision-making.
